NAME
----

nut-ipmipsu - Driver for IPMI Power Supply Units (PSU)

SYNOPSIS
--------

*nut-ipmipsu* -h

*nut-ipmipsu* -a 'PSU_NAME' ['OPTIONS']

NOTE: This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
nut-ipmipsu driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

This driver supports a wide range of PSUs through local IPMI interface.

nut-ipmipsu uses the GNU FreeIPMI project, for IPMI implementation.


EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver doesn't support any optional settings.

INSTALLATION
------------

This driver is not built by default.  You can build it by using
"configure --with-ipmi=yes".

INSTANT COMMANDS
----------------

This driver doesn't support any instant commands.

IMPLEMENTATION
--------------

The "port" value is used to identify the PSU.  For instance, to target
FRU 0x2, use the following in *ups.conf*:

	[pdu]
		driver = nut-ipmipsu
		port = id2
#		serial = 1234

------------
In the current NUT version (2.6.1), ups.status is still exposed, with the value
"WAIT".
