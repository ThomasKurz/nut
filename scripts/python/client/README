Python NUT Client files
-----------------------

This directory contains various NUT Client related Python scripts, written by
David Goncalves, and released under GPL v3.

* "module": this directory contains PyNUTClient.py, which is a Python
abstraction class to access NUT server(s). You can use it in Python programs
to access NUT's upsd data server in a simple way, without having to know the NUT
protocol.

To import it on Python programs you have to use the following (case sensitive) :
'import PyNUTClient'

To install the PyNUTClient class on Debian/Ubuntu, copy it to:
/usr/share/python-support/python-pynut/

This directory also contains test_nutclient.py, which is a PyNUTClient test
program. For this to be fully functional, you will need to adapt the login,
password and upsname to fit your configuration.


* "app": this directory contains the NUT-Monitor application, that uses the
PyNUTClient class, along with its resources.

To install it, you will either need to keep the files together, or to install
gui.glade to /usr/share/nut-monitor/, and nut-monitor.png to something like
/usr/share/pixmaps/
