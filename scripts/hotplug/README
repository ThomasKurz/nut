This document introduces Hotplug script for newhidups.
These are needed to ensure the right privileges are
set on the usb files (ie allowing nut user to read
AND write to the UPS device

Usage
-----
These scripts are to be used with Linux 2.4

- possibly change libhidups to match NUT user
- copy libhidups and libhid.usermap to /etc/hotplug/usb/
- call update-usb.usermap

You can then plug your UPS, and start NUT.

TODO
----
- improve these script (add other mfrs when possible)
- add configure rules and a Makefile for easier installation
- check for the new udev on kernel 2.6
